  opening: "Hi judges! I'm Goldie. MCX sells the same gold in four sizes, at four different prices. Team NEXORA asked one question: is the gap real money, or a mirage?",
  stage2: "Look at the raw prices. They seem far apart. Now watch me price them the same way. The real gap is only six hundred eighty-seven rupees per ten grams.",
  1: "Meet Team NEXORA. Divyansh built the data and quant pipeline, Ishant built the frontend, and Noni led research and the pitch.",
  2: "Big raw gap, tiny real gap. Lot sizes, purity, expiry and costs all hide the truth, and backtests can easily cheat by peeking at the future.",
  3: "Step one: price every contract the same way. When we divide by purity and quote grams, the gap shrinks from one lakh thirty-four thousand rupees to just six hundred eighty-seven rupees.",
  4: "Step two: track the gap over three years. Notice the gold dots: eight trades won big during the twenty twenty-six crash, but outside that crash, trades were flat or negative.",
  5: "Step three: the z-score. We only look when the gap is more than two standard deviations from normal. Today, only the mini versus petal pair flags at minus two point one four.",
  6: "Step four: the cost hurdle. Even if the z-score flags, the gap must beat forty-eight point eight basis points of round-trip costs. Today, thirty-five point eight basis points fails this check.",
  7: "Here is a real example from thirty September. The gap is unusual, but it is only thirty-five point eight basis points, and a trade needs forty-eight point eight. One failed check is enough. So I stay quiet.",
  8: "Step five: the walk-forward test. We train on twenty-four months, lock every rule, and test on twelve unseen months. No peeking, and signals at today's close only execute tomorrow.",
  9: "The headline results look good: twenty trades, one lakh thirteen thousand rupees profit, and a Sharpe of one point eight nine. But is it real?",
  10: "Break it down by pair. Mini versus petal made fifty-two thousand rupees. Guinea versus petal made twenty-eight thousand. Four of five pairs made money, but sample sizes are tiny.",
  11: "Where did the profit come from? Look at the three-D columns: eight trades during the twenty twenty-six crash made one lakh thirty-eight thousand rupees. The other twelve trades lost twenty-four thousand. One crash carried the strategy.",
  12: "Slippage is deadly. At our baseline of five basis points, the strategy barely survives. If slippage doubles to ten basis points, test profit drops to thirty-three thousand rupees and training loses even more.",
  13: "The normal gap isn't constant. Look at guinea versus petal: the gap shifted from two hundred basis points down to one basis point. A static model breaks when market structure shifts.",
  14: "Zero runtime servers. A Python pipeline processes eleven thousand nine hundred fifty-four rows with eighteen automated tests, producing static JSON. Nothing can crash during the demo.",
  15: "MCX gold trading grew three point four times in a single year, reaching twenty-eight thousand crore rupees daily. The market is large and growing.",
  16: "Four key takeaways: normalization matters, costs dominate, crash attribution reveals the truth, and clean data is non-negotiable. Our next step is paper trading with live tick data.",
  17: "Thank you, judges! Please try the live terminal at gold-r-v dot vercel dot app while we take your questions.",

// Speaker Notes for Judges / Presenter (N key)
const speakerNotes = {
  1: "Welcome judges. Team NEXORA built Gold RV Intelligence to investigate cross-contract commodity pricing on MCX. We mathematically normalized all four gold contracts to pure gold and tested whether cross-contract spreads survive real-world execution costs. Our headline finding is simple and honest: the gaps are real, but a proven edge after costs is not.",
  2: "Raw quotes look wildly dispersed—over 1.3 lakh rupees apart—because MCX quotes 1g, 8g, 10g, and 100g in different quote units and purities. Once normalized to pure gold, the actual gap is only 687 rupees, or 46 basis points. The problem is that once you account for real trading costs, carry, and liquidity, this apparent arbitrage completely evaporates.",
  3: "Slide 3 explains our mathematical normalization. MCX quotes 1g, 8g, 10g, and 100g contracts in different quote units and purities (995 vs 999). By dividing close price by quote grams and purity, we bring every contract to an identical 10g pure gold baseline. This collapses the superficial ₹1,34,186 raw gap down to an honest ₹687 (46.2 bps).",
  4: "Slide 4 shows the 3-year historical time series of the GOLDM-GOLDPETAL gap. Over 750 trading days, the gap fluctuates around its rolling mean within a 2-sigma band. Most importantly, look at the distribution of trades: 8 trades during the Q1 2026 crash delivered ₹1,37,985 in gains, while the 12 trades outside the crash netted -₹24,387.",
  5: "Slide 5 introduces the statistical entry rule: the Z-score. A trade is only considered when the spread deviates more than 2 standard deviations from its rolling mean. In today's snapshot, only GOLDM vs GOLDPETAL passes this first hurdle at z = -2.14, while all 5 other pairs sit within the normal zone.",
  6: "Slide 6 breaks down our transaction cost hurdle. Cross-contract trades pay exchange turnover charges, SEBI turnover fees, stamp duty, STT/CTT, GST, and realistic bid-ask slippage (5 bps per leg). The round-trip cost is 24.4 bps, requiring a minimum gap of 2x cost = 48.8 bps before entering. Today's gap of 35.8 bps fails this gate.",
  7: "This live example from September 30, 2026 demonstrates our discipline. The z-score of 2.14 exceeds the 2.0 hurdle, but the gap of 35.8 basis points is less than twice our round-trip transaction costs of 48.8 basis points. The gate fails, so the system stays quiet rather than generating unprofitable churn.",
  8: "Slide 8 details our walk-forward validation framework. We train on 24 months (Oct 2023 - Sep 2025) and evaluate on 12 unseen months (Oct 2025 - Sep 2026). Five strict safeguards eliminate look-ahead bias: t+1 execution, zero parameter tuning on test data, liquidity volume filters, and strict cost deductions.",
  9: "Slide 9 presents our test-set performance metrics: 20 trades, +₹1,13,598 net profit, Sharpe 1.89, and max drawdown -₹19,056. However, training lost -₹34,812. Under rigorous statistical standards, an out-of-sample t-statistic under 2.0 and negative training performance mean no persistent edge is proven.",
  10: "Slide 10 decomposes results across all 6 contract pairs. GOLDM-GOLDPETAL contributed +₹52,883 across 5 trades, while GOLDGUINEA-GOLDPETAL contributed +₹28,348 across 5 trades. Five pairs were profitable, but low trade counts (2 to 5 per pair) make statistical significance impossible to claim.",
  11: "Slide 11 delivers our crucial honest attribution. In the 3D columns, the 8 crash trades in Jan-Mar 2026 generated +₹1,37,985, while all other 12 trades lost -₹24,387. The waterfall chart on the right shows how gross spread profits of ₹1,85,431 are reduced by ₹73,578 in real execution costs to leave ₹1,13,598 net.",
  12: "Slide 12 tests robustness across varying slippage assumptions: 0 bps, 2 bps, 5 bps (our baseline), and 10 bps. While zero slippage shows +₹1,67,110 profit, doubling slippage to 10 bps cuts test profit to +₹33,391 and worsens training losses to -₹56,419. Breakeven slippage is approximately 3.8 bps.",
  13: "Slide 13 reveals why static relative value models fail in commodity markets: structural basis drift. GOLDGUINEA vs GOLDPETAL quarterly average basis collapsed from 201 bps down to 1 bps over two years. A rule relying on a fixed historical 'normal' will suffer catastrophic drawdowns during regime shifts.",
  14: "Slide 14 details our zero-runtime-server architecture. Our automated Python pipeline ingests official MCX Bhavcopy, normalizes contract specifications, and verifies data integrity across 11,954 rows and 138 contracts with 18 automated tests. The entire output compiles to static JSON for instant offline delivery.",
  15: "Slide 15 highlights the commercial scale. MCX gold futures turnover surged 3.4x to ₹28,340 crore daily, with gold accounting for 57% of total exchange bullion turnover. This massive liquidity pool makes even modest relative value strategies viable for proprietary trading desks and hedgers.",
  16: "Slide 16 summarizes our key takeaways and engineering roadmap. The four core principles: normalize first, respect costs, attribute profits honestly, and automate tests. Our roadmap outlines immediate live paper trading, near-term tick-level slippage measurement, and later cross-commodity expansion to silver.",
  17: "Thank you judges for your time and thoughtful evaluation. We invite you to explore the live terminal at gold-rv.vercel.app or review our audited codebase on GitHub. We are now open for your questions.",
